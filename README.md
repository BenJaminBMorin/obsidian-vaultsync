## Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Working

1. **Check Connection**: Verify API URL is correct
2. **Check Authentication**: Ensure you're logged in
3. **Check Permissions**: Verify vault access permissions
4. **View Logs**: Open sync log for detailed errors

### Files Not Syncing

1. **Check File Size**: Files over max size won't sync
2. **Check Selective Sync**: Ensure folder is included
3. **Check File Type**: Some file types may be excluded
4. **Force Sync**: Use "Sync Now" command

### Conflicts

1. **Use Auto-Resolution**: Enable automatic conflict resolution
2. **Check Backups**: Conflicted versions saved to `.conflicts/`
3. **Manual Resolution**: Edit files to resolve manually
4. **Reset Sync**: Clear state and re-sync if needed

### Common Issues

**"Authentication Failed"**
- Re-login through plugin settings
- Check API URL is correct
- Verify account credentials

**"Network Error"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify API server is reachable
- Check firewall/proxy settings

**"Quota Exceeded"**
- Check account storage limits
- Delete unnecessary files
- Upgrade account plan

## Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- **End-to-End Encryption** - Optional encryption for sensitive notes
- **Secure Transport** - All data sent over HTTPS
- **Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions
- **Data Ownership** - You own your data

### Self-Hosting
VaultSync supports self-hosting for complete control:

1. Deploy VaultSync server (see [docs](https://docs.vaultsync.io))
2. Point plugin to your server URL
3. Manage your own data and backups

## Performance

### Optimization Tips

- **Selective Sync**: Exclude large media folders
- **File Size Limits**: Set appropriate limits
- **Sync Interval**: Increase for slower connections
- **Offline Mode**: Use when traveling

### Benchmarks

- **Small Vault** (<100 files): ~2-5 seconds
- **Medium Vault** (100-1000 files): ~10-30 seconds
- **Large Vault** (>1000 files): ~1-3 minutes

*Initial sync times. Incremental syncs are much faster.*
